              <P>-I had the privilege of volunteering in a tree-planting activity in Brgy Gaas, Ormoc City. It was an eye-opening experience to witness the effort of the local community to help restore their environment. I was moved by the enthusiasm of the people to take part in the activity, which was more than just planting trees. We also discussed the importance of caring for the environment and how it can have a positive impact. After the tree-planting activity, I gained a better appreciation for the importance of environmental conservation. I am proud to have been part of this meaningful activity and I look forward to doing more in the future.
              <p>-I have also had the opportunity to work as a vendor in wines and other drinks. During my time as a vendor, I have developed a great understanding of the different types of wines and other drinks available, the different flavours and styles, and the best way to pair them with food. I have also had the chance to interact with different customers, learning a great deal about their preferences and needs. My experience as a vendor has been invaluable in helping me to better understand the wine and beverage industry.</P>
